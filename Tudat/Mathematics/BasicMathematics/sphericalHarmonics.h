 * This function returns a vector with the derivatives of a generic potential field (defined by
 * spherical harmonics). It is assumed that the potential field of a single harmonic is
 * characterized by:
 * \f[
 *     U = A \left( \frac{ R }{ r} \right) ^{ n + 1}
 *     P _{ n, m } ( \sin \phi ) \left[ C _{ n, m } \cos( m \lambda ) + S _{ n, m } \sin( \lambda )
 *     \right]
 * \f]
 * in which \f$ A \f$ is the generic multiplication factor, \f$ R \f$ is the radius of the harmonics
 * reference sphere, \f$ P _{ n, m }( \sin \phi ) \f$ is the associated Legendre polynomial with
 * \f$ \sin \phi \f$  as polynomial parameter, \f$ r \f$ is the radial coordinate, \f$ \phi \f$ is
 * the latitude coordinate, \f$ \lambda \f$ is the longitude coordinate, \f$ n \f$ is the harmonics
 * degree, \f$ m \f$ is the harmonics order, \f$ C _{ n, m } \f$ is the cosine harmonics
 * coefficient, and \f$ S _{ n, m } \f$ is the sine harmonics coefficient.
 *
 * The potential derivatives are calculated through:
 * \f{eqnarray*}{
 *     \frac{ \mathrm{ d } U }{ \mathrm{ d } r } = -\frac{ A }{ r } \left( \frac{ R }{ r } \right)
 *     ^{ n + 1 } ( n + 1 ) P_{ n, m }( \sin \phi )[ C_{ n, m } \cos( m \lambda ) + S_{ n,m }
 *     \sin( m \lambda ) ] \\
 *     \frac{ \mathrm{ d } U }{ \mathrm{ d } \phi } = A \left( \frac{ R }{ r } \right)^{ n + 1 }
 *     \frac{ \mathrm{ d } [ P( \sin \phi ) ] }{ \mathrm{ d } [ \sin \phi ] } \cos \phi
 *     [ C_{ n, m } \cos( m \lambda ) + S_{ n, m } \sin( m \lambda ) ] \\
 *     \frac{ \mathrm{ d } U }{ \mathrm{ d } \lambda } = A \left( \frac{ R }{ r } \right)^{ n + 1 }
 *     m P_{ n, m }( \sin \phi ) [ S_{ n, m } \cos( m \lambda ) - C_{ n, m }
 *     \sin( m \lambda ) ]

 *          term.

 *          term.
 * \param legendrePolynomial Value of associated Legendre polynomial with the same degree and order
 *          as the to be computed harmonic, and with the sine of the latitude coordinate as
 *          polynomial parameter. Make sure that the Legendre polynomial has the same
 *          normalization as the harmonic coefficients.
 * \param legendrePolynomialDerivative Value of the derivative of parameter 'legendrePolynomial'
 *          with respect to the sine of the latitude angle.
 * \return Vector with derivatives of potential field.
 *          The order is important!
 *          gradient( 0 ) = derivative with respect to radial distance,
 *          gradient( 1 ) = derivative with respect to latitude angle,
