 *      110224    F.M. Engelen      File created.
 *      110324    J. Melman         Added overloaded get functions.
 *      110427    F.M. Engelen      Changed input parameter to altitude, longitude and latitude.
 *      110629    F.M. Engelen      Added predefined feature.
 *      110705    F.M. Engelen      Changed to passing by reference. Changed reference values.
 *
 *    References
 *
 *    The accuracy of this model could be increased by implementing different values for the scale
 *    height and temperature for different altitudes (e.g., lower, middle and upper atmosphere).
