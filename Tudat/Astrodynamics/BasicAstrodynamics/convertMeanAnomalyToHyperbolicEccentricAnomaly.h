 *    Notes
 *      There are known to be some issues on some systems with near-parabolic orbits that are very
 *      close to eccentricity=1.0. For these orbits, the unit tests establish that they are able
 *      to generate consistent results by converting to and from hyperbolic eccentric anomaly to a
 *      precision of 1.0e-9. If this quality of solution is not adequate for specific applications,
 *      the user should investigate the code further.
