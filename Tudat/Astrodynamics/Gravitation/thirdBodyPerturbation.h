//! Compute perturbing acceleration by third body.
/*!
 * Computes the perturbing acceleration on a point mass in orbit about a central body (point mass),
 * caused by a third body (point mass). This acceleration is expressed with respect to a
 * pseudo-inertial reference frame centered at the central body body, i.e, a non-rotating frame
 * aligned with an inertial reference frame. This acceleration may be summed with other third body
 * accelerations in order to get the total gravitational perturbation acceleration of N bodies
 * (Wakker, 2010; Montenbruck & Gill, 2005).
 * \param gravitationalParameterOfPerturbingBody The gravitational parameter of the perturbing body,
 *      i.e., the third body.                                                             [m^3/s^2]
 * \param positionOfPerturbingBody The position of the third body, the body that
 *      causes the perturbations, in Cartesian coordinates.
 *          positionOfPerturbingBody( 0 ) = x-position                                          [m]
 *          positionOfPerturbingBody( 1 ) = y-position                                          [m]
 *          positionOfPerturbingBody( 2 ) = z-position                                          [m]
 * \param positionOfAffectedBody The position of the second body, the body that
 *      experiences the perturbation, in Cartesian coordinates.
 *          positionOfAffectedBody( 0 ) = x-position                                            [m]
 *          positionOfAffectedBody( 1 ) = y-position                                            [m]
 *          positionOfAffectedBody( 2 ) = z-position                                            [m]
 * \param positionOfCentralBody The position of the central body, the body w.r.t. which the
 *      acceleration is calculated the perturbation, in Cartesian coordinates (default=origin).
 *          positionOfAffectedBody( 0 ) = x-position                                            [m]
 *          positionOfAffectedBody( 1 ) = y-position                                            [m]
 *          positionOfAffectedBody( 2 ) = z-position                                            [m]
 * \return perturbingAcceleration The perturbing acceleration in Cartesian components, that gives
 *      the difference of the total acceleration with the central two-body acceleration.
 *          perturbingAcceleration( 0 ) = x-acceleration                                    [m/s^2]
 *          perturbingAcceleration( 1 ) = y-acceleration                                    [m/s^2]
 *          perturbingAcceleration( 2 ) = z-acceleration                                    [m/s^2]
