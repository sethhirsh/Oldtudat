/*!
 * Returns the value of the Jacobi energy in normalized units of the CRTBP, given in the following
 * equation (Wakker, 2007):
 * \f[
 *      C_{J} = x^{2} + y^{2} + 2 * \left(\frac{1-\mu}{r_{1}} + \frac{\mu}{r_{2}}\right) - V^{2},
 * \f]
 * where \f$C_{J}\f$ is the Jacobi energy, \f$x\f$ and \f$y\f$ are Cartesian position coordinates
 * of the third body, \f$mu\f$ is the gravitational parameter of the secondary, \f$r_{1}\f$ and
 * \f$r_{2}\f$ are the distances from the third body to the primaries, and \f$V\f$ is the magnitude
 * of the velocity of the third body. This equation assumes that the system has been normalized
 * such that the mean motion of the primiaries, and their mutual distance is equal to 1.
 * \param massParameter Mass parameter of three-body system.
 * \param stateInNormalizedUnits State of third body in normalized units.
 * \return Jacobi energy in normalized units.
