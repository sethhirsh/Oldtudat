/*!
 * Templated class that generates a composite state derivative model based on a map of pointers to
 * state-derivative-model functions provided by the user. The map indexes the composite state
 * so that the correct state derivative functions are called for each part state. This can be used,
 * for instance, to numerically integrate the state of multiple satellites around a central body,
 * each subject to their own state-derivative model, or the state of a satellite and the associated
 * State Transition Matrix. The class has been set up in a general fashion such that it can be used
 * in many other simulation scenarios too.
 * \tparam IndependentVariableType Data type for independent variable, e.g., time, (default is
 *          double).
 * \tparam CompositeStateType Data type for composite state (default is Eigen::MatrixXd).
 * \tparam PartStateType Data type for individual part states that are part of the composite state
 *          (default is same data type as CompositeStateType).
