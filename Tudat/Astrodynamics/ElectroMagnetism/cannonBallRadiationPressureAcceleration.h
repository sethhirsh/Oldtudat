 * Computes radiation pressure acceleration using a cannon-ball model, i.e. assuming force to be in

 * opposite direction of the vector to the source.
 * \param radiationPressure Radiation pressure at target. N.B: the usual way of computing the
 *          radiation pressure at the target, in case the source is the Sun, is to take the
 *          radiation presssure at 1 AU and scale it based on the distance from the Sun     [N/m^2]
 * \param vectorToSource Vector pointing from target to source. N.B: this must be a unit
 *          vector! To compute the unit vector based on a given position vector, you can
 *          use the .normalize() or .normalized() member functions of an Eigen::Vector3d
 *          object.                                                                             [-]
 * \param area Area on which radiation pressure is assumed to act.                            [m^2]

 *          emmisivitty, assuming no diffuse reflection.                                        [-]
