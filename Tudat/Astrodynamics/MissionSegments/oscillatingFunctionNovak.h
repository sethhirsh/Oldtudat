 *    Notes
 *      This file contains a specific oscillating function, which is described by Novak and Vasile
 *      [2011] (See also Novak [2012] and Wall and Novak [2012]). This function is a mathematical
 *      representation of the (out-of-plane) elevation angle, phi (in spherical coordinates), of a
 *      thrusting spacecraft. This oscillating function can be used to approximate a
 *      continuous-thrust trajectory (also referred to as a low-thrust trajectory), when combined
 *      with a function which represents the radial position, r (in spherical coordinates), of a
 *      thrusting spacecraft. The spherical coordinate system that is used for the calculations and
 *      the descriptions is taken from Novak and Vasile [2011].

/*!
 * This class contains an oscillating function, and its exact first and second derivative w.r.t.
 * the azimuthal angle \f$ \theta \f$. It is a mathematical function, and can be used to
 * approximate the out-of-plane motion of a thrusting spacecraft. The function is documented by
 * Novak and Vasile [2011]. It approximates the (out-of-plane) elevation angle of the spacecraft.
 * The (out-of-plane) elevation angle is parameterized in terms of an independent variable, the
 * (in-plane) azimuthal angle \f$ \theta \f$. The first and second derivative are taken with
 * respect to this independent variable.
 *
 * The function is completely described by the independent variable \f$ \theta \f$ and a set of
 * four parameters. These parameters are related to the boundary conditions of the problem: two
 * initial conditions and two final conditions. These parameters are passed to this class as
 * boost::functions to facilitate the flexible external manipulation of their values.
