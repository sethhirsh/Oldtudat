 *    Changelog
 *      YYMMDD    Author            Comment
 *      101111    E. Iorfida        File created.
 *      101126    E. Iorfida        Virtual void "solve" added.
 *      101206    E. Iorfida        setInitialLambertState added, protected variables added.
 *      101207    E. Iorfida        Set single variables, change variables names in more
 *                                  understandable ones.
 *      110113    E. Iorfida        Added necessary elements to build pointer-to-member-function to
 *                                  RootFinderAlgorithms and NewtonRaphsonMethod classes.
 *      110124    E. Iorfida        Added necessary piece of code to be able to use the last
 *                                  version of Newton-Raphson code.
 *      110130    J. Melman         Simplified variable names, e.g., 'normOfVelocityVector' became
 *                                  'speed'. Also corrected 'tangential' to 'transverse'.
 *      110201    E. Iorfida        Added pointerToCelestialBody and modified variable names
 *                                  (from heliocentric, to inertial).
 *      110208    E. Iorfida        Added CartesianPositionElements objects as input and
 *                                  CartesianVelocityElements objects as output.
 *      120326    D. Dirkx          Changed raw pointers to shared pointers.
 *      120620    T. Secretin       Adapted and moved code from LambertTargeter.h.
 *      120813    P. Musegaas       Changed code to new root finding structure. Added option to
 *                                  specify which rootfinder and termination conditions to use.
 *      130121    K. Kumar          Added shared-ptr typedef.
