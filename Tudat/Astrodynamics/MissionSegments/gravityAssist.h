 *      110117    E. Iorfida        Creation of code.
 *      110128    E. Iorfida        Added member variables necessary for the unit tests.
 *      110202    J. Melman         Changed several names and suggested minor restructuring of
 *                                  class.
 *      110203    E. Iorfida        Changed some variable names and modified punctuation.

 *                                  Changed and added some notes.
 *      110208    E. Iorfida        Added CartesianVelocityElements objects as input. Deleted
 *                                  inheritance from TrajectoryDesignMethod.
 *      110212    J. Melman         Made delta-V private. getDeltaV changed into computeDeltaV.
 *      110214    E. Iorfida        Deleted temporary centralBodyRadius, replaced by an element
 *                                  of GeometricShapes.
 *      120326    D. Dirkx          Changed raw pointers to shared pointers.
 *      120417    T. Secretin       Moved set functions to constructor.
 *      120508    P. Musegaas       The gravitational parameter is now passed as double, made some
 *                                  variables constant.
 *      120530    P. Musegaas       Complete revision. Removed class structure, made it a free
 *                                  function. Added two functions for propagating a gravity assist
 *                                  (powered and unpowered).
 *      120625    P. Musegaas       Minor changes.
 *      120703    T. Secretin       Minor layout changes. Changed constructor.
 *      120713    P. Musegaas       Added option to iterate on pericenter radius instead of
 *                                  eccentricity. Added separate class for this and a flag in free
 *                                  function.
 *      120813    P. Musegaas       Changed code to new root finding structure. Added option to
 *                                  specify which rootfinder and termination conditions to use.
 *
 *    Notes
 *      Note that the exact implementation of Newton-Raphson as root finder should be updated if
 *      someone would want to use a different root-finding technique.
 *
 *      By default the eccentricity is used as the iteration procedure. This is because in
 *      optimizing a Cassini-like trajectory, the pericenter radius had about 2-4 NaN values in
 *      100000 times the gravity assist calculation. The eccentricity iteration had no NaN values
 *      for a similar run in which 100000 gravity assist calculations were done. Also the
 *      eccentricity seemed to require slightly less iterations (does not necessarily mean it is
 *      faster or more accurate).
