 *    Notes
 *      This file contains the improved inverse polynomial function, which is described by Wall et
 *      al. [2010] (See also Wall and Novak [2012]). This function is a mathematical representation
 *      of the radial position, r (in spherical coordinates), of a thrusting spacecraft. The
 *      improved inverse polynomial function can be used to approximate a continuous-thrust
 *      trajectory (also referred to as a low-thrust trajectory), when combined with a function
 *      which represents the (out-of-plane) elevation angle, phi (in spherical coordinates), of a
 *      thrusting spacecraft. The spherical coordinate system that is used for the calculations and
 *      the descriptions is taken from Novak and Vasile [2011].

//! Improved inverse polynomial function approximating the radial position of a thrusting
//! spacecraft.
/*!
 * This class contains an improved inverse polynomial function, and its exact first and second
 * derivative w.r.t. the azimuthal angle \f$ \theta \f$. It is a mathematical function, and can be
 * used to approximate the radial position of a thrusting spacecraft. The function is documented
 * by Wall et al. [2010] as the "improved inverse polynomial method". The radial position of the
 * spacecraft is parameterized in terms of an independent variable, the (in-plane) azimuthal angle
 * \f$ \theta \f$. The first and second derivative are taken with respect to this independent
 * variable.
 *
 * The function is completely described by the independent variable \f$ \theta \f$ and a set of
 * seven parameters. These parameters are related to the boundary conditions of the problem: three
 * initial conditions, three final conditions and the total time-of-flight. One of the parameters
 * is used to solve for the time-of-flight and is therefore a time-dependent parameter. These
 * seven parameters are passed to this class as boost::functions to facilitate the flexible
 * external manipulation of their values.
